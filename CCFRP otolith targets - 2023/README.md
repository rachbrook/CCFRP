Summaries of the [California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program](https://www.ccfrp.org/) used for stock assessments

# Description    
The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP) is the only statewide hook-and-line survey for the nearshore fisheries in California.  



# Notes on length data
- Each university partner measures fish using different methods    
- The length data within the database and in this repo have not be standardized
- The total length column contains lengths other than total length

**Total Length**: Scripps (SIO), University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), Cal Poly Humbodlt (HSU, formerly Humboldt State University) and Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML) measure total length, 
allowing the caudal fin to splay naturally.        
**Fork Length**: Cal Poly (CP) and University of California Davis Bodega Marine Lab (BML) measure fork length.

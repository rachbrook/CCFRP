\section{First Pass at Determining 2022 Otolith Collections}\label{first-pass-at-determining-2022-otolith-collections}}

The following use only data from 2019, 2021 and 2022 from the reference areas. Drifts that did not see any of the target species are also excluded. I also excluded the following MPA locations, Farallons, Point Conception, Laguna Beach, Trinidad and ``BM'' (error?).

As a first pass, I looked at the total number of a given species by north and south
of Point Conception. I did this because we have been separating assessments at
Point Conception for most of the nearshore species, and species compositions and
fishing practices are fundamentally different in these two regions.\\
If there were fewer than 4 of a given species seen across the three years, I
excluded them from the collections analysis. I also removed yelloweye rockfish
and the olive or yellowtail rockfish category.

I then took the ratios of a
species within by CCFRP institution and scaled that to either a collection total
for each region of 50 samples (otoliths) or 70\% of the total. In an assessment model,
we usually exclude any age data with fewer than 30 samples per year.

I realize that we need to scale back some of the collections by programs, e.g., BML,
and also figure out if we should lingcod. The NWFSC is currently exploring
a comparison of lingcod otoliths reads with spine. Collection of spine is a bit more
difficult. There is also an interest in developing post-fillet back calculations
for lingcod. What I'd like to hear from each partner, is the maximum number of
otoliths you think you could possibly collect. We will also have staff available
to process fish (as long as COVID trends the right direction).

For species that are less common, otoliths can still be used to look at growth
curves, e.g.~copper and quillback this cycle.

I will clean up the tables below and look at a few other metrics including
available habitat in the reference sites for each university's site to make sure
we're scaling samples approporiately.

This document lives on my Github page and will allow us to reproduce these values
as a moving window going forward, and also adjust according to assessment
prioritization. The Council will decide a preliminary assessments for the odd year
in the prior even year, with final decisions coming in June. That should give us
time to adjust these numbers for special collections.

We also have an interest in fin clips, especially for vermilion/sunsets and also
blue/deacons.
